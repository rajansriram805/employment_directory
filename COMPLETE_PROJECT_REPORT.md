# 4. CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

## 4.1 Challenge: MongoDB Connection Issues

### Problem
Initially experienced connection timeouts and buffering errors when trying to connect to MongoDB. The error `MongooseError: Operation buffering timed out` was occurring frequently.

### Root Causes Identified
1. Multiple connection attempts without proper connection pooling
2. Connection established before it was truly ready
3. Invalid Mongoose connection options (`bufferMaxEntries` not supported)
4. Routes loading before database connection was established

### Solutions Implemented

**Solution 1: Connection Caching**
- Implemented global connection caching to prevent multiple connection instances
- Used Next.js global object to cache connection across hot reloads

**Solution 2: Simplified Connection Options**
- Removed invalid options like `bufferMaxEntries` and `bufferCommands`
- Used only supported Mongoose options: `useNewUrlParser`, `useUnifiedTopology`

**Solution 3: Proper Connection Timing**
- Ensured routes are loaded only after database connection is confirmed
- Added connection verification with ping before allowing operations

**Result:** Stable MongoDB connection with no timeout errors.

## 4.2 Challenge: JWT Token Management

### Problem
Need to securely manage authentication tokens across the application without exposing them or causing authentication issues.

### Solutions Implemented

**Solution 1: Token Storage**
- Stored JWT tokens in localStorage for client-side persistence
- Implemented token refresh mechanism

**Solution 2: Axios Interceptors**
- Created axios interceptors to automatically attach tokens to requests
- Implemented automatic logout on 401 responses

**Solution 3: Secure Token Verification**
- Server-side token verification on all protected routes
- Token expiration handling

**Result:** Secure and seamless authentication flow.

## 4.3 Challenge: Role-Based Access Control

### Problem
Need to restrict access to certain features and API endpoints based on user roles (job_seeker, employer, admin).

### Solutions Implemented

**Solution 1: Role Verification in API Routes**
- Implemented role checks in API endpoints
- Returned 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access

**Solution 2: Protected Routes**
- Implemented client-side route protection using React Context
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login page

**Solution 3: Conditional UI Rendering**
- Show/hide features based on user role
- Different dashboards for different user types

**Result:** Proper role-based access control throughout the application.

## 4.4 Challenge: Form Validation and Error Handling

### Problem
Need to validate user input on both client and server side to prevent invalid data and provide good user experience.

### Solutions Implemented

**Solution 1: Client-Side Validation**
- HTML5 form validation (required, minLength, type)
- Custom validation messages
- Disabled submit button during submission

**Solution 2: Server-Side Validation**
- Check all required fields
- Validate email format
- Verify password length
- Check for duplicate users

**Solution 3: User-Friendly Error Messages**
- Clear error messages returned from API
- Display errors in UI with proper styling
- Success messages for completed actions

**Result:** Robust validation with good user feedback.

## 4.5 Challenge: Database Schema Relationships

### Problem
Need to properly model relationships between Users, Jobs, and Applications with proper references and population.

### Solutions Implemented

**Solution 1: Proper Schema Design**
- Used Mongoose ObjectId references
- Defined relationships: User to Job (one-to-many), User to Application (one-to-many)

**Solution 2: Population**
- Used Mongoose `.populate()` to fetch related documents
- Populated employer and applicant data when needed

**Solution 3: Array References**
- Jobs store array of application IDs
- Applications reference both job and applicant

**Result:** Proper data relationships with efficient queries.

## 4.6 Challenge: State Management Across Components

### Problem
Need to share authentication state across multiple components without prop drilling.

### Solutions Implemented

**Solution 1: React Context API**
- Created `AuthProvider` context for global auth state
- Provided `useAuth` hook for easy access

**Solution 2: Local State for Component-Specific Data**
- Used useState for component-specific data
- Combined with Context for global state

**Result:** Clean state management without prop drilling.

## 4.7 Challenge: TypeScript Type Definitions

### Problem
Need proper TypeScript types for all models, API responses, and component props.

### Solutions Implemented

**Solution 1: Interface Definitions**
- Created interfaces for User, Job, Application
- Typed API responses

**Solution 2: Type Assertions**
- Used type assertions for API responses
- Proper typing for MongoDB documents

**Result:** Type-safe code with IntelliSense support.

## 4.8 Challenge: Responsive Design

### Problem
Ensure the application works well on all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### Solutions Implemented

**Solution 1: Tailwind CSS Responsive Utilities**
- Used Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Grid layouts that adapt to screen size

**Solution 2: Mobile-First Design**
- Designed for mobile first, then enhanced for larger screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing

**Result:** Fully responsive application across all devices.
